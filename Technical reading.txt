Technical Reading Assignment
========

1. This command creates a gem called "Foodie" and creates a scaffold directory while initializing a git repository in the directory. 
2. In the spec folder. 
3. spec.add_dependency "activesupport", "4.0.0"
4.    Writing a Generator

    1.   Define the generator class 

        * desc "recipe", "Generates a recipe scaffold

        * def recipe(group,name)

        * Foodie::Generators::Recipe.start([group, name])

        * end

    2.   Require the file for the class by adding a line to the lib/foodie/cli.rb

        * require 'foodie/generators/recipe'

    3.   Require Thor::Group including Thor::Actions

        *    Require 'thor/group'

            *    module Foodie

                *    module Generators

                    *    class Recipe < Thor::Group

                        *    include Thor::Actions

                        * argument :group, :type => :string

                        * argument :name, :type => :string

                    * end

                * end

            * end
    4.   Define methods in the class
        *    def create_group
            * empty directory(group)
        * end
    5. Use template method to copy file
        *    def copy_recipe
            *    template("recipe.txt", "#{group}/#{name}.txt")
        * end
    6. Test generator by running bundle exec bin/foodie recipe dinner steak
    7. Define source_root as directed by 
        *    def self.source_root
            *    File.dirname(_FILE_) + "/recipe"
        * end
    8. Create text template .txt
